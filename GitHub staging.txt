You can submit/upload files into your repo via GitHub.com and bypass GitKraken this works on ANY computer. 

So if you save your documents to your google drive and use it to upload into GitHub.com the theory is you will always have your stuff with a back up.

The theory is even without internet access I would still have stuff saved to my device and could still work on it.
